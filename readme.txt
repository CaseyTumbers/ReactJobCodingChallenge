Project was made in Webstorm IDE, using React App, with Node.js installed.
npm start will run code.

Assumptions Made:
 - If locations are in both Mn and Md, display colour for Mn, ie green.
 - .json files will always be in correct format.
 - When file is uploaded, all locations are displayed in black. Colours are 
updated and lines are drawn as N and D inputs are entered.
 - Text is centered on position, but moved up slightly so not obscuring point.
